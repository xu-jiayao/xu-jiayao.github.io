# 🙋‍♀️ Profile 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hosei University in March 2024 and my M.S. degree in September 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Jinjia Zhou](https://www.zhou-lab.info/jinjia-zhou).

My **research interest** lies in _**Image Codec design**_ based on _**Compressive Sensing**_, which encompasses _**Hardware Implementation**_ and _**Deep Learning**_. 

Throughout my doctoral and master's studies, I have authored **10 papers**, most of which have been published in leading conferences and journals in the fields of image processing and hardware implementation, including **TMM, CVM, MMM, ISCAS, DCC, ICIP, IJCNN**, among others. 

I possess a strong ability for **self-directed learning** and have **independently acquired knowledge** in areas relevant to my research topic during my graduate studies, as well as in iOS application development during my undergraduate studies.

I will be joining Pengcheng Laboratory on September 9, 2024, to work on compression technology related to remote sensing.

<font size = 4><u><b>Compressive Sensing Based Image Codec With Partial Pre-Calculation</b></u></font>

**Jiayao Xu**, Jian Yang, Fuma Kimishima, Ittetsu Taniguchi, Jinjia Zhou

<font color=darkred> IEEE Transaction on Multimedia, 2023</font>


<font color=darkred> (<b>IF = 8.182</b>, Top Journal in Image Processing) </font>

**Key Idea**: 

Break the current codec framework and analyze the data characteristics within each process. Utilize the sparsity of matrices and processed data to introduce an innovative codec framework based on Compressive Sensing.

<font size = 4><u><b>Real-time FPGA Design for OMP Targeting 8K image Reconstruction</b></u></font>

**Jiayao Xu**, Chen Fu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinjia Zhou

<font color=darkred>28th International Conference on Multimedia Modeling (MMM), 2022</font>

**Key Idea**: 

Due to hardware limitations in sampling, we begin our work with a deterministic matrix. 
We utilize the sparsity of the chosen sensing matrix to streamline calculations in each iteration of reconstruction. 

Experimental results demonstrate a <font color=darkred><u>speedup of 290 times</u></font> compared to the state-of-the-art method, enabling <font color=darkred><u>real-time reconstruction of 8K grayscale images at 30 FPS.</u></font>

<font size = 4><u><b>An 81.92Gpixels/s Fast Reconstruction of Images from Compressively Sensed Measurements</b></u></font>

**Jiayao Xu**, Pham Do Kim Chi, Chen Fu, Jinjia Zhou

<font color=darkred>The IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), 2022</font>

**Key Idea**: 

We employ a sparse sensing matrix composed mainly of zero-vectors, resulting in an invertible full-rank matrix after removing these vectors, enabling the replacement of the iteration-based reconstruction procedure with a single matrix multiplication. 

The result shows that our work accelerates the state-of-the-art method by <font color=darkred><u>65 × and achieves 81.92Gpixels/s reconstruction.</u></font>

<font size = 4><u><b>Plug-and-Play Adaptive Block Compressive Sensing using Edge-Detection on the Compressed Domain</b></u></font>

**Jiayao Xu**, Yibo Fan, Jinjia Zhou

**Key Idea**: 

We recognize the correlation between edge detection and Compressive Sensing sampling, proposing an adaptive method that directly processes sampled data, thereby cutting time and hardware costs. 

Experimental comparisons against traditional and learning-based techniques <font color=darkred><u>consistently reveal superior results</u></font>.

<font size = 4><u><b>High-speed Compressed Sensing Reconstruction using Zigzag Ordering based Parallel Processing</b></u></font>

**Jiayao Xu**, Jirayu Peetakul, Muchen Li, Jinjia Zhou

<font color=darkred>International Conference on Video and Image Processing (ICVIP), 2020</font>

**Key Idea**: 

We implement Zigzag ordering-based parallelism in the reconstruction process to ensure efficient calculations between blocks during parallel reconstruction. 

Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm accelerates the baseline algorithm by <font color=darkred> <u>3.26 to 7.13 times</u></font>.
